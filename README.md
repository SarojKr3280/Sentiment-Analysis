# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project is a Sentiment Analysis system built using machine learning models to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. 

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: The IMDB movie review dataset [Downloaded from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
- **Techniques**: Data Preprocessing, Tokenization, TF-IDF, Classical ML (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes).
- **Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy, Matplotlib.
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and utilities.
- `models/`: Saved model files.
- `reports/`: Contains evaluation metrics and plots.
- `main.py`: Script to run the pipeline end-to-end.

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
nltk
joblib

## How to Run

1. Run the Jupyter notebooks for EDA and preprocessing (`preprocessing.ipynb`).
2. Train models using `Classical_Model.ipynb`.
3. Evaluate models, compare results, and save metrics/plots.
4. Execute `main.py` for an end-to-end pipeline.
